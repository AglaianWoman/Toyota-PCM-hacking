This repo is dedicated to hacking toyota powertrain control modules.The specific focus is
going to be 4A-GE related PCMs, then perhaps the 1UZ PCM and anything else anyone requests.


Hot items: 
toyota bluetop pcm/cap.asm - a working disassembly of the bluetop code, slowly being understood

Notes: 

The Bluetop PCM uses a nippondenso specific issue of the hitachi HD6301v1 processor.
Subsequent PCMs (open exceptions of course ;) use the toshiba 8x processor.

CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT: The d151801 REQUIRES the power rails to come up BEFORE being released from /STBY.
Failure to do so will cause unpredictible behaviour on the bus ports, including but not limited to
bus contention during the latter half of the positive E-clk cycle.

A copy of dasm got lumped in here because it was what I used to assemble the reader code 
for the D151801 bluetop microprocessor. Nobody associated with this repo is responsible 
for dasm.

SCHEMATICS are done with ExpressPCB custom software, available free from their website. I 
know it sucks... and I apologize.

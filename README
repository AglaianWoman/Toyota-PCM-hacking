This repo is dedicated to hacking toyota powertrain control modules.The specific focus is
going to be 4A-GE related PCMs, then perhaps the 1UZ PCM and anything else anyone requests.


Hot items: 
toyota bluetop pcm/cap.asm - a working disassembly of the bluetop code, slowly being understood,
This is a disassebmly of the AE86 Bluetop code, from chip denso d151801-0642

Toyota 1uz pcm/cap *.asm - working disassemblies of the two d151803 microprocessors inside a
92~94 SC400 PCM. Specific part numbers are d151803-9260 (8243) and d151803-1320 (8568)

Notes: 

The Bluetop PCM uses a nippondenso specific issue of the hitachi HD6301v1 processor.
1UZ PCM uses the toshiba 8x processor.

CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT: The d151801 REQUIRES the power rails to come up BEFORE being released from /res.
Failure to do so will cause unpredictible behaviour.

D151801 also has some special extra hardware compared to the vanilla HD6301: 192 bytes of RAM starting
at 0x0040; and an extra input capture/output compare module, using port 1-0 and port 1-1, with
registers at 0x18 (byte), 0x1b (word) and 0x1d (word). basically the extra timer hardware is cloned
from the normal hardware, registers moved up 0x10 bytes and driven by the timer at 0x0009. timer
interrupts are muxed between both set of hardware. See {cap,cmp}{1,2}test.asm

A copy of dasm got lumped in here because it was what I used to assemble the reader code 
for the D151801 bluetop microprocessor. Nobody associated with this repo is responsible 
for dasm.

SCHEMATICS are done with ExpressPCB custom software, available free from their website. I 
know it sucks... and I apologize.

bluetop/cap.bin is the same as cap1-151801-0642.bin, literally pulled from the same chip two different
times. apologies that the main disassembly is cap.asm, and not the more appropriately named 
cap1-151801-0642.asm

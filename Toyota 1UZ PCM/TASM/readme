Denso 8x module for Table Driven Assembler
==========================================

NOTES:
v3.0	- updated TASM32.exe to v3.3 March 2009 compile date (note change to 
	tasm32.exe name) with specific D8X bit commands compiled in, updated 
	TASM8X.tab table file to use new D8X bit commands.

v2.0	-updated to include revised 3-byte instruction for opcode 0A
	Kashi decodes opcode 3A and 0A as the same function ( a 2 byte function 
	st x, _addr8_ ). I believe opcode 0A should be a 3 byte function using 
	a 16 bit address. st x, _addr16_.

v1.0	-initial release


======================================================================

Install the free version of TASM that can be downloaded from 

http://home.comcast.net/~tasm/index.htm

1) Install the Denso 8X processor table:
	a) Put TASM8x.TAB in TASM subdirectory.
	b) Put tasm8x.bat in a directory in your PATH.


2) Edit tasm8x.bat to match your directory locations for the table and tasm.exe binary

3) Try assembling the included test program from the command line using:

tasm8x.bat test1.asm  

You should get a compiled binary (test2.obj) and  a listing file (test2.lst). 
No errors should be generated.


Have fun!

bison: best instant subjugator of nippondensos - just a sad BUFFALO ripoff really.
===================================================================================

code loader, tester and debugger for toyota MCU

features:
human friendly text input
load code into ram (automatically stick an NMI at the end)
load data bytes from prompt into ram
display ram
run ram
NMI returns to the monitor
user stack separate from buffalo stack

unfeatures:
cannot toy with interupts really - perhaps fixed interrupt handlers? 
i like that, redirect interrupt to handlers in ram which by default NMI back into the monitor.
